PROJECT TITLE: 2.04 Assignment
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To practice Java ints and dbls
VERSION or DATE: 9/15/14
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT : compile and run
AUTHORS: David Johnson
USER INSTRUCTIONS: GLHF!

PMR: The project was easily understood but tedious. It was great practice 
to learn ints and dbls well, they are really stuck in my head now that 
I've typed them over and over. I would like to do something similar or 
improve upon this program by using arrays.
